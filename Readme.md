#Abstract
Natural disasters, such as floods and landslides, can lead to significant sediment transport and redistribution within landscape complexes, posing risks to ecosystems and communities. This study presents a novel approach for identifying accumulation zones within post-disaster landscape complexes, leveraging sediment transport models as predictive tools. Rather than relying on traditional prediction methods, which often involve machine learning techniques, we harness the power of sediment transport modelling to delineate areas of sediment accumulation.

The methodology involves the integration of terrain analysis, hydrological modeling, and sediment transport simulations. By incorporating detailed landscape characteristics, hydrological patterns, and sediment transport dynamics, our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of accumulation zone formation. The sediment transport models are validated using field measurements and historical data, enhancing the reliability of the results.

In a case study focused on a recent disaster-affected landscape, we apply the proposed methodology to reveal spatial patterns of sediment accumulation. The findings provide valuable insights into the areas most prone to sediment deposition after a disaster event, aiding in effective land management and risk mitigation strategies. Furthermore, this approach showcases the potential of sediment transport models as alternative tools for identifying accumulation zones, offering a computationally efficient and scientifically grounded solution.

This research contributes to the broader field of disaster impact assessment and landscape management by offering a methodology that diverges from prevalent machine learning-based approaches. By embracing sediment transport models, we present a resourceful and accurate technique for mapping accumulation zones within landscape complexes following natural disasters.
